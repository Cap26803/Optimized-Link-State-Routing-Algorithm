# Link State Routing Visualization

This project provides a dynamic visualization of a network using the Link State Routing algorithm. The visualization is implemented using HTML, CSS, and the D3.js library for JavaScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>


   # Link State Routing Visualization

1. **Getting Started**

    - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
    
    - Input the number of nodes and the source node in the provided fields.
    
    - Click the "Visualize" button to see the Link State Routing algorithm in action.

2. **Project Structure**

    - **index.html:** Defines the HTML structure of the webpage, including input fields, buttons, and the container for the network visualization.
    
    - **styles.css:** Contains the styles for links, nodes, and node text. It also defines the appearance of the source node with a red fill.
    
    - **script.js:** Implements the logic for dynamic network generation and visualization using D3.js. It handles user input, creates SVG elements, and updates the visualization based on simulation ticks.

3. **Customization**

    - Feel free to customize the project by adjusting the number of nodes, source node, or styles in the CSS file to suit your preferences.

4. **Features**

    - Dynamic visualization of a network using the Link State Routing algorithm.
    
    - User-friendly interface for inputting the number of nodes and selecting the source node.

5. **Usage Example**

    - Include screenshots, GIFs, or a brief description of the visualization in action.

6. **Contributing**

    - Contributions are welcome! Please follow the contribution guidelines when submitting pull requests.

7. **License**
